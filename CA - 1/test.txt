Start

Create a Tkinter window
Set window title, size, background color, and icon
Display a label for the menu title
Create LabelFrames for different menu sections (e.g., Rice/Pasta, Proteins, Soups & Swallows, Side Dishes, Beverages)
Add items to each LabelFrame with Label widgets displaying food and beverage options along with their prices

Define a function to handle order placement:
    Initialize a dictionary to store food prices
    Initialize an empty list to store the order items
    Initialize a variable to store the total price
    Start a loop:
        Prompt the user to input the food item and quantity
        Split the input to get the item name and quantity
        Check if the item name is valid and quantity is a digit
        If valid, calculate the item price and add it to the order list and update the total price
        Ask the user if they want to continue ordering
        If yes, continue the loop; if no, exit the loop
    Display an order summary with the list of ordered items and total price

Create a "Place Order" button linked to the order function
Run the Tkinter event loop
End
