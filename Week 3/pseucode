Print "Quadratic Equation or Cubic Equation (Q or C)"
Read user response as input
 If response is 'Q' (quadratic equation), then:
    Print "a"
    Read a as input
    Print "b"
    Read b as input
    Print "c"
    Read c as input
    Calculate discriminant
    If discriminant is positive, then:
        Calculate roots using quadratic formula
        Print the roots
    If discriminant is zero, then:
        Calculate root using quadratic formula
        Print the root
    If discriminant is negative, then:
        Print "No real roots"
If response is 'C' (cubic equation), then:
    Print "a"
    Read a as input
    Print "b"
    Read b as input
    Print "c"
    Read c as input
    Print "d"
    Read d as input
    Initialize variable i to 1
    Repeat until i is less than or equal to 10:
        Calculate value of the cubic equation at i
        If calculation is zero, then:
            Print "Root found: x = i"
        Increment i by 1
If response is neither 'Q' nor 'C', then:
    Print "Invalid input"
