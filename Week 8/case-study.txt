CASE STUDY: Facebook's EMOTIONAL CONTAGION experiment

In 2014, it was reported that Facebook conducted an experiment to observe emotional contagion.
- Emotional contagion is the unintentional transfer of feelings to others, sometimes subconsciously (Wikipedia)

What was the ethical problem ?
- Well, Facebook did not collect consent for the test they conducted on their users. They changed the feed that appears on the users feed.
- They changed their algorithm to show either positive or negative feeds and show the users either positive or negative feeds

Facebook violated several ethics, including:
1. Not asking user for consent when changing their algorithms design
2. Disrespecting the privacy of their users after they had gained the trust of the app
3. Impacted the psychology of their users
